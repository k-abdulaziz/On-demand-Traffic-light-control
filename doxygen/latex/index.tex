This document is intended to provide information about on-\/demand traffic light control system including its description, design, state machine and constraints.\hypertarget{index_Section2}{}\doxysection{2.\+System Description}\label{index_Section2}
This system aims to provide traffic organization for both cars and pedestrians and the normal mode of the system is for cars unless a pedestrian push the button.

It consists of\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Traffic light for cars
\item Traffic light for pedestrians
\item Push button for pedestrians
\end{DoxyEnumerate}



It works in two main modes\+:

Normal Mode\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Cars\textquotesingle{} LEDs will be changed every five seconds starting from Green then yellow then red then yellow then Green.
\item The Yellow LED will blink for five seconds before moving to Green or Red LEDs.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Pedestrian Mode\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Change from normal mode to pedestrian mode when the pedestrian button is pressed.
\item If pressed when the cars\textquotesingle{} Red LED is on, the pedestrian\textquotesingle{}s Green LED and the cars\textquotesingle{} Red LEDs will be on for five seconds, this means that pedestrians can cross the street while the pedestrian\textquotesingle{}s Green LED is on.
\item If pressed when the cars\textquotesingle{} Green LED is on or the cars\textquotesingle{} Yellow LED is blinking, the pedestrian Red LED will be on then both Yellow LEDs start to blink for five seconds, then the cars\textquotesingle{} Red LED and pedestrian Green LEDs are on for five seconds, this means that pedestrian must wait until the Green LED is on.
\item At the end of the two states, the cars\textquotesingle{} Red LED will be off and both Yellow LEDs start blinking for 5 seconds and the pedestrian\textquotesingle{}s Green LED is still on.
\item After the five seconds the pedestrian Green LED will be off and both the pedestrian Red LED and the cars\textquotesingle{} Green LED will be on.
\item Traffic lights signals are going to the normal mode again.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item AVR Atmega32 Microcontroller
\item 2 green leds
\item 2 yellow leds
\item 2 red leds
\item 6 resistors of 300 ohms
\item 1 resistor of 10k ohms
\item 1 bush button
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_sub2}{}\doxysubsection{3.\+2 System Schematic Circuit\+:}\label{index_sub2}
As shown beyond\+: -\/Push button is connected to INT0 pin for pedestrian -\/LEDs for cars -\/ Green, Yellow, and Red, connected on port A, pins 0, 1, and 2 -\/LEDs for pedestrians -\/ Green, Yellow, and Red, connected on port B, pins 0, 1, and 2

\hypertarget{index_sub3}{}\doxysubsection{3.\+3 Static architecture\+:}\label{index_sub3}
The system is divided in 4 main layers\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Microcontroller (MCU) Layer
\item Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL)
\item Electronic Unit Abstraction Layer (ECUAL)
\item Application Layer
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The system is divided into 5 drivers\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item DIO driver
\item External interrupt driver
\item Timer driver
\item LED driver
\item Button driver
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
